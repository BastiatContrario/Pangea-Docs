# Pangea-Docs

The community is one of the driving forces of BITNATION. To be resilient, we need a decentralised community of contributors, as much as a decentralised technology. It doesnâ€™t matter what your profession is, your skill level, your nationality, age, education or gender. Everyone is welcome to join in to help make BITNATION and our Pangea software a success that changes the status quo of governance.
