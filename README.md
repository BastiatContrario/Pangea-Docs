# BITNATION and Pangea Docs and Contributor Guidelines


The community is one of the driving forces of BITNATION. To be resilient, we need a decentralised community of contributors, as much as a decentralised technology. It doesnâ€™t matter what your profession is, your skill level, your nationality, age, education or gender. Everyone is welcome to join in to help make BITNATION and our Pangea software a success that changes the status quo of governance. 


To get to know us, the best place to start is through:


* Join our community on [Slack](https://bitn.slack.com).
* Participate in tasks on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/rb43zuUn/bitnation-dev).
* Contribute to our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bit-Nation).

## **Community Resources**


If you want to contribute to the growth of the Bitnation community and our mission - this is the place for you.

The best place to get to know the community is to join our [Slack](https://bitn.slack.com) channel and start contributing.
It's helpful to write a short introduction about yourself and what you're interested in doing. Keep in mind that the Slack chat is *not* encrypted, and it's open for anyone to join, hence don't share anything you think could compromise your security, and use a pseudonym if you want to remain anoymous. Popular channels you can join includes the #_bitnation-dev channel, the #_bitnation-marketing channel, #townhall, #intros, and #watercooler
