# BITNATION and Pangea Docs and Contributor Guidelines


The community is one of the driving forces of BITNATION. To be resilient, we need a decentralised community of contributors, as much as a decentralised technology. It doesn’t matter what your profession is, your skill level, your nationality, age, education or gender. Everyone is welcome to join in to help make BITNATION and our Pangea software a success that changes the status quo of governance. 


To get to know us, the best place to start is through:


* Join our community on [Slack](https://bitn.slack.com).
* Participate in tasks on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/rb43zuUn/bitnation-dev).

## **Community Resources**


If you want to contribute to the growth of the Bitnation community and our mission - this is the place for you.

The best place to get to know the community is to join our [Slack](https://bitn.slack.com) channel and start contributing.
It's helpful to write a short introduction about yourself and what you're interested in doing. Keep in mind that the Slack chat is *not* encrypted, and it's open for anyone to join, hence don't share anything you think could compromise your security, and use a pseudonym if you want to remain anoymous. Popular channels you can join includes the #_bitnation-dev channel, the #_bitnation-marketing channel, #townhall, #intros, and #watercooler


### *_Join the Ambassador and Embassy Networks_* 


The Ambassador and Embassy networks were conceived as analogue versions of Pangea. A real world network of people and places where digital nomads can get advice, peer-to-peer assistance, meet-up and hang out. There are three types of Bitnation representatives:

* Diplomatic Ambassadors: Official Bitnation positions to perform duties as Officers working as our interface with existing Nations, as well as new virtual Nations. 
* Diplomatic Consuls: Also an Official position. A support to both our Ambassadors and to Nation State embassies and consulates engaging with our Citizens in the location of our Embassies and Consulates. 
* Goodwill Ambassadors: Informal but officially recognised representative of Bitnation during events (such as DEVCONs). Promotes and supports Bitnation and our services and provides a point of contact for our Citizens. 

Embassies and Consulates are where share their space, whether it’s an office, coffee shop or your home, and open it up for fellow citizens, hackers and crypto aficionados around the world! There are two types of places, Embassies and Consulates.

* Embassy  A place where you can both live, and work (and naturally, meet)
* Consulate A place where you can work – like a shared office space or cafe, for instance – or maybe organise a meetup or a hangout.

Bitnation has over 100 embassies, consulates worldwide. You can find out more about the [Ambassador Network](https://bitnation.co/ambassador-network/) or [Register as an Embassy](https://bitnation.co/embassy-consulate-directory/) on our website. **All these functions will soon be moved from the website to the Pangea software.**
