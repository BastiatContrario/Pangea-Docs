# Pangea-Docs


The community is one of the driving forces of BITNATION. To be resilient, we need a decentralised community of contributors, as much as a decentralised technology. It doesnâ€™t matter what your profession is, your skill level, your nationality, age, education or gender. Everyone is welcome to join in to help make BITNATION and our Pangea software a success that changes the status quo of governance. 


To get to know us, the best place to start is through:


* Join our community on [Slack](https://bitn.slack.com).
* Participate in tasks on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/rb43zuUn/bitnation-dev).
* Contribute to our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bit-Nation).
